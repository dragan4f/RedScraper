Use your common sense, if a predator lies down next to a prey animal do you think the prey animal is just going to lie there?\n  \n    It\u2019s one thing to be wrong but just doubling down on stupid is ridiculous. Your information is incorrect. You were lied to about a silly urban legend and you fell for it.\n  \n    Snakes also don\u2019t unhinge their jaws. It can look like it, but they just have a jaw structure that allows them to open really wide. It\u2019s not technically jaw dislocation.\n  \n    You could easily clear this crap up with five seconds of googling you know. It\u2019s not hard info to find."
