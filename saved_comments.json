Use your common sense, if a predator lies down next to a prey animal do you think the prey animal is just going to lie there?\n  \n    It\u2019s one thing to be wrong but just doubling down on stupid is ridiculous. Your information is incorrect. You were lied to about a silly urban legend and you fell for it.\n  \n    Snakes also don\u2019t unhinge their jaws. It can look like it, but they just have a jaw structure that allows them to open really wide. It\u2019s not technically jaw dislocation.\n  \n    You could easily clear this crap up with five seconds of googling you know. It\u2019s not hard info to find."

Die bauen eigene Batteriespeicher, und k\u00f6nnen andere Automobilhersteller, die ja momentan alle auf EV umsatteln, in Zukunft mit Akkus beliefern. Haben ein Supercharger Netzwerk welches sie servicebasiert f\u00fcr Fremdmarken anbieten, Solarzellen, eigene engineering automation Maschinen, viel h\u00f6herer profit per sale als andere Automobilhersteller, effizientester Herstellungsprozess, etc.\n  \n    Meiner Meinung nach sind mittlerweile die ganzen kurzzeitigen schlechten News eingepreist. H\u00f6her erwartete Abs\u00e4tze, Twitter, elon musk selling tsla shares (wohl der Hauptgrund f\u00fcr den price drop) und was noch so in den Medien (oder auf Reddit) hochgespielt wird. Wenn es wirklich unter 100 f\u00e4llt dann ist es overhated, und nicht overvalued imo. Man kann die Gr\u00fcnde nicht ignorieren, Tesla ist einfach nicht vergleichbar mit anderen Automobilherstellern an der B\u00f6rse. Und wenn du dich in einer Masse an Menschen widerfindest, dann halte kurz inne, und \u00fcberlege selbst ob ohne Einfluss von anderen du diese Entscheidung auch treffen w\u00fcrdest. Weil den Markt voraussehen kann keiner von den 80 Upvotern. Und nat\u00fcrlich auch nicht ich, ich teile nur meine eigene Meinung, no financial advice. Aber wenn Tesla wieder in besserem Licht stehen sollte, und sich die \u201eTesla Army\u201c an der B\u00f6rse mobilisiert, dann sollten sich Put Holders in Acht nehmen.\n  \n    Fazit: Tesla ist imo overhated, aufgrund oben genannter Gr\u00fcnde.\n  \n    Edit: und wieder wird 0 auf Gr\u00fcnde eingegangen, oder ordentliche Gegenargumente gebracht, sondern einfach gedownvoted. Tesla Haters sind mittlerweile ja schlimmer als Tesla Fanboys gef\u00fchlt. Dieser Sub ist wirklich lost, sogar r/wsb checkt mehr was abgeht."

Also kann man nicht pauschal sagen, dass man vom Markt immer profitieren kann mit ETFs. Aber grunds\u00e4tzlich magst du recht haben. Wobei man bei sektor-spezifischen ETFs auch aufpassen muss weil es einige Faktoren gibt die den ganzen Sektor beeinflussen. Ich finde wenn du etwas Geld \u00fcbrig hast zum Spielen welches du wohl die n\u00e4chsten Jahre oder sogar Jahrzente nicht dringend brauchst, dann kann man ruhig auch Einzelaktien kaufen.

If your spouse is going to cheat, you will only delay the inevitable if you interfere, if you confront prematurely.\n  \n    I do believe in clearly establishing mutual boundaries early in a committed relationship.  I do believe in maintaining said boundaries by paying attention, and reinforcing said boundaries with good communication.\n  \n    I would continue to pay attention, with discretion.  Refrain from snooping unless your gut instincts or a preponderance of evidence compels you to snoop.  If you do find yourself snooping, be a good objective investigator where the subject is always presumed innocent until proven guilty.  Do not confront prematurely or recklessly.  You can wreck a good marriage if you handle this ham handedly.  Save your evidence and never reveal your sources if you\u2019re going to confront.  Confront only from a position of confidence, where you\u2019re confident in your findings."

Good separation between collateral muscle groups.\n  \n    Abs get a focused workout once every five days and partial workouts every other day since they recover so quickly.\n  \n    I spend no more than 1-hour in the gym.  I leave my phone in the car.  I rest only 90 seconds between sets.  I superset a push with a pull exercise.  I keep the reps down and the weight up.  I add variation to avoid boredom and muscle adaptation plateaus, which includes rep:weight ratios.  I wear gloves so that my muscle fails before skin.\n  \n    If you can only get 5-days in the gym, this split can tolerate without compromising gains much."
